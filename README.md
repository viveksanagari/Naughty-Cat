# Naughty-Cat

# Only for linux users

Naughty-Cat creates a tiny cute naughty cat which chases around your cursor all the time. It chases you very actively when you play with it by moving the cursor. It gets bored very soon and it goes to sleep if you dont move the cursor for 5 seconds. 

How to use the Naughty-Cat:

    (step 1) Clone the 'Naughty-Cat' from github using the below command in terminal.
              "git clone https://github.com/viveksanagari/Naughty-Cat.git"
    (step 2) Make the 'Naughty-Cat' folder as executable using "chmod +x Naughty-Cat/*.sh"
    (step 3) "cd Naughty-Cat"
    (step 4) "./naughty-cat.sh"
    (step 5) ...Enjoy... :)

Clarification: 

     1) steps 1 and 2 has to be done only for the first time along with steps 3 and 4, later use requires
     steps 3 and 4 only.  
     2) The cat exists till the system is shutdown, If you want to stop the cat chasing you at any time
     run the 'stop.sh' file using "./stop.sh" in the Naughty-Cat folder.
